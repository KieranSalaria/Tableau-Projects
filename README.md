## Key Topics & Skills Demonstrated (Tableau)

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis in Tableau

**What I worked on:**
I explored unfamiliar datasets (global health data and Spotify audio features) to understand structure, metrics, and relationships before building visualisations.

**Skills learned:**

* Connecting and loading Excel and CSV datasets into Tableau
* Understanding measures vs dimensions
* Exploring data distributions and key variables
* Asking analytical questions to guide visual design
* Identifying relevant metrics for organisational insight

### 3. Dashboard Design & User Interaction

**What I worked on:**
I combined multiple worksheets into interactive dashboards and published them to Tableau Public. Using the Spotify dataset, I conducted open-ended analysis to uncover trends across genres, popularity, tempo, energy, and valence.
